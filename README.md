## Context
For the production of medical tablets, it is important to know how the manufacturing process affects the composition. To do this, one first needs to be able to identify the different components in the tablet based on micro-CT images. The data for the project has been provided by AstraZeneca. The tablets are produced with three different methods, namely the direct compression method, the rolling compaction method and the twin-screw granulation method. 

## Project
The project is to design a method for distinguishing tablet components in micro-CT images using image segmentation. 

## Responsibilities
- Account for image preprocessing.
- Use image segmentation technique to determine the location and spread of various components in the tablets.
- Analyze by calculating the share of each component and compare to the theoretical values provided by AstraZeneca AB.

## Environment
Windows, Matlab.
